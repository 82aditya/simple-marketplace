# simple-marketplace

this is just repositories example for marketplace app that maybe i will never finished. However, i hope this repo can give a glimpse of how marketplace look like, that contain some data-management such a RDBMS. Oh i planned to use node.js in this app too. Still long way to go. Maybe i will change my mind, when i've enough knowledge of web development to complete this repo, and make fully app with polished UI too in the future.
